// Implements: ADR 0024 (the annotated worksheet, not a chat app)
//
// The old status bar was a permanent colored card — GREEN, forever, to
// announce that nothing was wrong: the loudest treatment for the most boring
// fact. This is its replacement: a 28px strip flush under the header. One
// quiet line when things work; while a turn is in flight, a 1px maroon
// hairline sweeps along its bottom edge — the panel's ONE indeterminate
// indicator. Degraded states don't render here at all: the caller swaps the
// strip for a <Notice>, which owns everything that has a severity.
