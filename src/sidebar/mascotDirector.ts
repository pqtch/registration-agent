// The mascot movement director (pure core). The raw stream flips the desired
// pose every time a tool starts or finishes — and tools return fast
// (run_what_if in ~1s), so a direct event→pose mapping blinks: Patch only ever
// saw ponder and idle because the what-if pose never held. This reducer sits
// between the stream and the mascot and gives every pose a real beat: a
// minimum hold, a short queue so a new state waits its turn instead of
// clobbering the current one, and coalescing so a repeated tool doesn't
// re-queue. The React wiring + timers live in useMascotDirector.ts; keeping the
// logic pure makes the min-hold / coalesce / drain-cap rules unit-testable.
