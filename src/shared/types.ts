  // Set when the tool THREW. The worker still emits a terminal AI_TOOL_RESULT
  // (otherwise the chip spins forever), but with `courseCount: 0` — which is a
  // chip-resolved marker, NOT a claim of zero results. Read `error` first: a
  // failed search found nothing *because it failed*, and rendering "0 results"
  // tells the student a lie. See ADR 0028.
  error?: string;
  // Panel-only (ADR 0037): the sections a catalog search actually returned,
  // structured for the section cards. Never sent to the model: the model got
  // the compact JSON in the tool_result, and toolEvents never enter the
  // prompt path (conversationalOnly, ADR 0028).
  courses?: PanelCourse[];

// The panel's view of a search result: the same courses and sections the model
// received, with meetings kept structured (the model gets them as strings).

  // renders these as chips above the message body. Stripped before the list

  toolEvents?: ToolEvent[];
  // When present, this message renders as a system-action bubble instead of
  // AI prose (e.g. onboarding batch-save at end of intake). Streaming handlers
  // treat systemAction bubbles as non-append targets so the next AI chunk
  // creates a fresh bubble. Filtered out before the history is sent to
  // Anthropic — it represents a UI event, not a turn in the conversation.
  systemAction?: SystemAction;
}

// The single gate between what the student SEES and what the model is TOLD.
// Every path that ships history to the worker goes through this — do not
// hand-roll the filter at a call site. Implements: ADR 0028.
//
// The `uiOnly` flag this once also filtered is gone — ADR 0028's revisit
// clause (Alternative B) landed: errors and loop-exit notices render as
// turn-scoped <Notice>s and never enter `messages` at all, so there is
// nothing to strip. See ADR 0026.
export function conversationalOnly(
  messages: ConversationMessage[]

  // sections a search returned). The worker builds the prompt from role and

// ─── Long-term Memory (routing-table architecture) ───────────────────────────

// Memory writes come from a Haiku "curator" model that scans each chat turn
// for durable facts about the student (interests, constraints, goals). The
// main chat model (Sonnet) sees only the short `description` in a routing
// index, and must call `recall_memory` to load the full `content` on demand.
// See ADRs 0011–0015 in notes/decisions/ for the full design rationale.

export interface MemoryEntry {
  id: number;
  type: MemoryType;
  description: string; // ≤10 words; shown in the routing index
  content: string;     // full memory body; loaded via recall_memory
  // Verbatim quote from the student's message that triggered the save. Shown
  // in Settings as "you said: ..." so the student can trace why each memory
  // exists and trust the system. Optional because legacy entries predate
  // this field and the consolidation/dedup path merges may not preserve it.
  sourceQuote?: string;
  createdAt: number;   // epoch ms
  lastAccessedAt: number;
}

// Provisional interests — the curator's "maybe" tier. Soft signals (a topic
// the student hinted at but didn't explicitly commit to) land here instead of
// the memory store. When the same topic accumulates enough consistent hits
// across turns/sessions, it gets promoted to a real MemoryEntry. Absorbed
// (deleted) when a hard fact on the same topic arrives.
//
// Stored under a separate chrome.storage.local key so it never enters Sonnet's
// system prompt — only the curator (Haiku) sees these.
export interface ProvisionalInterest {
  id: number;
  topic: string;              // short topic identifier, e.g. "theology/middle-east"
